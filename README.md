# Up and Punning

Here are a few scripts, notes, and other crap to help me get up and running on
a new machine faaaaast.

The main `setup.sh` script runs the other setup scripts. It should be safe, but
fuck, I don't know. Good luck?

### Yeah but what do I do to do the this?

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ivanreese/up-and-punning.git && cd up-and-punning && bash setup.sh
```
